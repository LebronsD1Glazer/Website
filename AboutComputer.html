            <h2> MotherBoard </h2>
              <p> 

                The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer and serves as the central hub that connects and allows communication between all the system’s components. It holds crucial parts such as the CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (memory), storage drives, graphics card, and various other hardware components. It also contains connectors for input and output devices like keyboards, monitors, and USB ports.
                
                Essentially, the motherboard acts as the backbone of the computer. It distributes power to all components, enables data transfer between them through buses and chipsets, and ensures that everything works together smoothly. Different motherboards support specific CPUs and memory types, so compatibility is important when building or upgrading a computer.</p>

            <h2> PSU </h2>
            <p> The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is a critical component in a computer that provides and regulates the electrical power needed for all other parts to function. It converts the AC (alternating current) from a wall outlet into DC (direct current), which computer components like the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage devices require to operate.

                A PSU distributes power through different cables and connectors, each designed for specific components—such as the 24-pin connector for the motherboard, 8-pin connectors for the CPU and GPU, and SATA connectors for drives. It also ensures stable and clean power delivery, which helps prevent damage from voltage fluctuations or electrical surges.</p>
