            <h2>üñ±Ô∏è Input Devices of a Computer</h2>
            <p>
                Input devices are the tools that allow users to communicate and send data or commands to a computer. They are an essential part of the computer system, acting as the bridge between human actions and digital processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                An input device is any hardware component that sends information to the computer for processing. It captures data in different forms such as text, images, sound, or movement and converts it into a format that the computer can understand.
            </p>
            <h2> ‚öôÔ∏è Common Types of Input Devices </h2>
            
            <ol>
               <li> Keyboard</li>
               <p> The keyboard is one of the most widely used input devices. It allows users to type letters, numbers, and commands using keys arranged in a specific layout (like QWERTY). Keyboards are used for writing documents, coding, and controlling computer functions.</p>
               <li> Mouse</li>    
               <p> A mouse controls the movement of a pointer on the screen. It helps users select, drag, and interact with on-screen elements easily. Modern mice often use optical or laser sensors for high precision.</p>
               <li> Microphone </li> 
               <p> Microphones convert sound waves into digital data, allowing users to record audio, talk in online meetings, or give voice commands to virtual assistants.</p>

            <h2> üñ•Ô∏è Output Devices of a Computer  </h2>
            <p> Output devices are hardware components that display, project, or present the results of a computer‚Äôs processing to the user.
                While input devices allow us to give commands to a computer, output devices let the computer communicate back to us.  </p>
                <p> An output device takes information from the computer and converts it into a human readable or usable form  such as text, images, sound, or physical movement.
                    In short, output devices make digital data visible, audible, or tangible.</p>
                
                    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Common Types of Output Devices </h2>
                      <ol> 
                        <li> Monitor </li>
                        <p>The monitor is the most common output device. It visually displays text, images, videos, and user interfaces.
                            Modern monitors use LED or LCD technology and can support high-definition and 4K resolutions for sharp, vibrant visuals. </p>
                        <li> Printer</li>
                        <p> A printer produces a hard copy (physical output) of digital documents, images, or graphics.
                            Common types include</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>  Inkjet Printers: Use liquid ink  ideal for photo printing.</li>
                                <li> Laser Printers: Use toner powder  fast and cost-efficient for offices.</li>
                                <li> 3D Printers: Create three-dimensional objects by layering materials.  </li>  
                        </ul>
                        <li> Speakers</li>
                        <p> Speakers convert digital audio signals into sound waves, allowing users to listen to music, video calls, or system alerts.
                            They range from built-in laptop speakers to advanced surround sound systems.</p>
