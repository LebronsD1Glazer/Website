            <h2> What is Processing? </h2>
            <p>  Processing in a computer refers to the actions the computer takes to execute instructions and perform tasks. At its core, processing involves the CPU (Central Processing Unit), often called the “brain” of the computer, which interprets and carries out instructions from software, applications, and the operating system.

                When you run a program, open a file, or perform calculations, the CPU fetches the instructions from memory, decodes what needs to be done, executes the operation, and then stores the result back in memory or storage. This cycle is often called the fetch-decode-execute cycle.</p>

             <h2> CPU and GPU  </h2>
            <p> The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is often called the “brain” of a computer because it carries out most of the processing tasks. It interprets and executes instructions from programs, applications, and the operating system, allowing the computer to perform calculations, make decisions, and manage data.

                A CPU works through the fetch-decode-execute cycle: it fetches instructions from memory, decodes what needs to be done, and executes the operation. Modern CPUs have multiple cores, which allow them to perform many tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking and performance. They also include cache memory, a small, high-speed storage area that helps speed up access to frequently used data. </p>

        <p>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the creation of images, videos, and animations for a computer display. Unlike the CPU, which performs general-purpose computing tasks, the GPU excels at parallel processing, making it highly efficient for rendering graphics, performing complex calculations, and running tasks that involve large amounts of data simultaneously.

GPUs are commonly used for gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and scientific computations. Modern GPUs also support artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining, thanks to their ability to perform many calculations at once. They come in two main types: integrated GPUs, built into the CPU or motherboard for basic graphics needs, and dedicated (or discrete) GPUs, separate cards with their own memory (VRAM) for high-performance graphics.
