            <h2>  Storage </h2>
            <p>  Storage in a computer refers to the component or system that is used to save and retain digital data, both temporarily and permanently. It holds everything a computer needs to function, including the operating system, applications, files, and user data. Unlike memory (RAM), which only stores information while the computer is powered on, storage keeps data even after the device is turned off.</p>
            <p> There are several types of computer storage, each serving a different purpose. Primary storage, like RAM (Random Access Memory), is fast but temporary, used to hold data that the CPU needs immediately. Secondary storage, such as hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs), provides long-term data retention. HDDs use spinning disks and magnetic storage to store data, making them cost-effective for large capacities, while SSDs use flash memory, offering much faster data access and durability with no moving parts.</p> </p>

            <h2> Types of Storage  </h2>
             <p> HDDs are the traditional form of storage that have been used in computers for decades. They store data magnetically on spinning disks called platters. Each platter is coated with a magnetic material, and a small arm with a read/write head moves across the surface to read or record data. Because this process involves mechanical movement, HDDs are sometimes referred to as mechanical drives.</p> 
             <p> SSDs are a newer, faster type of storage that uses flash memory chips instead of spinning disks. This means there are no moving parts, which allows SSDs to read and write data much faster and operate silently. The lack of mechanical components also makes SSDs more durable and energy-efficient, as they generate less heat and are less susceptible to physical damage.</p>
            <p> RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) needs while performing tasks. It acts as a high-speed workspace that allows your computer to access information quickly, making programs run smoothly and efficiently. Unlike permanent storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is volatile, which means all data stored in it is lost when the computer is turned off or restarted. </p>

                <h2> Comparison and Use Cases </h2>
                    <p> While SSDs clearly outperform HDDs in speed and reliability, HDDs still remain popular because they are more affordable per gigabyte and available in much larger capacities (often several terabytes). Many users and organizations choose a hybrid setup, using an SSD as the primary drive for the operating system and frequently used applications, and an HDD for storing large files or backups.</p>
