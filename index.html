            <h2> 💻 What Are Computers?</h2>
            <p> 
                Computers are powerful electronic devices designed to process information and perform tasks with incredible speed and accuracy. From the smartphones in our pockets to the servers that run the internet, computers have become an essential part of modern life.
                At their core, computers receive input (data), process it using hardware and software, and produce output (results). This process happens in fractions of a second, allowing people to solve complex problems, create art, communicate, and explore new frontiers in science and technology.</p>
